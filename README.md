The primary goal is to learn and test how AI agents can autonomously retrieve and process weather data using APIs, all while leveraging AutoGen’s capabilities for multi-agent collaboration and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand AutoGen’s agent-based AI framework.
- Implement a simple AI agent that retrieves weather data from an API.
- Explore collaborative agent workflows for enhanced decision-making.
- Experiment with different prompts and agent interactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (3.12+ recommended)
- Microsoft AutoGen
- OpenAI API
- [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) (or any weather API of choice)
