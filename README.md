## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores basic agentic AI workflows using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), as a learning exercise.

The primary goal is to learn and test how AI agents can autonomously retrieve and process weather data using APIs, all while leveraging CrewAI's capabilities for multi-agent collaboration and decision-making. To extend the project further, I introduced an additional agent that suggests engaging indoor or outdoor activities for a given date and city based on weather conditions. This involves web scraping and decision-making based on weather forecasts.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand CrewAI’s agent-based AI framework, including Crews, Agents, Tasks and Tools.
- Implement a simple AI agent that uses a custom Tool for weather data API calls.
- Explore collaborative agent workflows for enhanced decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (3.12+ recommended)
- CrewAI
- OpenAI API
- [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) (or any weather API of choice)


## 🔄 Status

Project is: In Progress
