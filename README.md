## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores basic agentic AI workflows using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/).

The primary goal is to learn and test how AI agents can autonomously retrieve and process weather data using APIs, all while leveraging CrewAI's capabilities for multi-agent collaboration and decision-making.

This project was designed to explore CrewAI, even though a crew workflow isn't strictly necessary for this specific use case. The goal was to gain hands-on experience and understand its potential applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand CrewAI’s agent-based AI framework, including Crews, Agents, Tasks and Tools.
- Implement a simple AI agent that uses a custom Tool for weather data API calls. 
- Explore collaborative agent workflows for enhanced decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (3.12+ recommended)
- CrewAI
- OpenAI API
- [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) (or any weather API of choice)


## 🔄 Status

Project is: In Progress
